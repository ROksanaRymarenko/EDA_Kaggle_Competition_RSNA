# EDA_Kaggle_Competition_RSNA
EDA for the competition RSNA Breast Cancer Detection Competition on Kaggle

This Notebook is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the competition RSNA Breast Cancer Detection Competition on Kaggle.

RSNA - The Radiological Society of North America

In this notebook, we will be using a dataset that contains metadata for each patient.

The goal is to understand the characteristics of the data and identify any potential issues or inconsistencies that may need to be taken into considereation before moving on to the ML phase of analyses - identifying cases of breast cancer in mammograms.


The dataset contains data and radiographic female breast images

We will load the data and take a look at the structure of the meta data.
Besides that, we will perform some basic statistical analysis to get a sense of the overall distribution and range of values in the data.
Additionally, we will visualize the data in various ways to help us to get a better understanding of the relationships between different variables and the underlying patterns present in the data.
